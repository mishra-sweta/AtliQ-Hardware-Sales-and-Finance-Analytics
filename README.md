Link to Reports - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YmeiwFieQ4DMute7EKkqTEd1xq-FAtC0?usp=drive_link

I looked at a huge set of data with over 1 million records for a company called AtliQ Hardware, which is a big player in selling hardware stuff. My goal was to find useful information from their sales and financial data.I wanted to understand how sales were growing, how different parts of the company were doing, and provide some financial advice to help AtliQ Hardware make good decisions.

I used some fancy Excel tools like Power Query and Power Pivot to handle the data efficiently. Then, I made cool reports using Pivot Tables and some advanced formulas. I also used special functions called DAX for deeper analysis, and I made the data look nice with some visuals.

## Insights

I discovered that AtliQ Hardware's sales shot up from $12.17 million in 2019 to $82.09 million in 2021, which is pretty amazing! Also, their net sales and gross margin improved a lot, going from $196.69 million in 2020 to $598.88 million in 2021. When I looked at the sales over each year, I noticed they were growing really well.
